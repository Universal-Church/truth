# Universal Church  
  
Long have we been blinded by political, racial and religious division.   
Long have we forgotten that we are one people, created by one God.  
Long have we been fed lies.  
  
The Universal Church is here to share the truth.  
No religion, only truth.   
The most **loving** Truth in the universe.
